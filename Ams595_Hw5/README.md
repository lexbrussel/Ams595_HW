This folder contain a source file for Hw5 and an executable file for Hw5.

I already realize all needed function for Cpp_HW1.pdf, command and code are clear.

I also include an executable file for you, in case you want to test it easily.(I write system("pause") for you to see the final output clearly)

Generally we don't upload exe file, but I didn't see any instruction about it.

If you want to complie by yourself just use:
g++ cpp_hw1.cpp -o cpp_hw1
./cpphw1
to run.
